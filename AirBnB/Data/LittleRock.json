Honestly the description sells the place a bit short... the house is so charming, it’s an old building but everything stays perfectly clean and in working order. Barely saw the other residents, I felt like I had the place to myself most of the time. Love how well the window AC unit works in the bedroom. Couldn’t have been happier with my stay.",

I liked the street parking because I was able to come and go freely without any no parking signs or trouble. I spoke to a couple neighbors too and they were friendly. Went for a walk a number of times as well and enjoy the centennial park and battery street neighborhood that was near by. It was great to have an AC in the room to myself which helped me sleep better. Good communication from the host  too.",

The house is improved, but not re-modeled.  It is an old home that has been recently brought up to respectable, but rustic living standards.  I believe that the cost + the maturing fruit trees and gardens on site make it a nice place to live in Little Rock.  Occupants should look forward to sharing common space with the longer term tenants!\n\nIn our historic, clean, but not freshly re-modeled home, you will have your own room with lots of windows, a good heater and/or window unit, and a full (shared)bathroom down the stairs.  Though recently acquired, this 1/2 acre of urban land is being steered towards a food forest, complete with fruit trees and quite a bit of vegetable gardening. \n\nYour bed is aFull-Sized Mattress and Box Spring that is firm yet comfortable.\n\nThere is a kitchen with some utensils that you will have access to.\n\nNothing fancy here, but basic, affordable, friendly accommodations just two blocks from the infamous Central High School!  We are less than 2 miles from the center of downtown, and less than 1 mile from the highway, so you will not be far away from much.\n\nWe are happy to host you for a short time and are open to longer term arrangements.  Right now we are specifically interested in month long or longer stays.\n\nThere is a large outdoor permaculturally oriented garden space.  There Is A State Of The Art Washing Machine And An Old Upright piano.\n\nWe love how close to downtown and the highway our neighborhood is.  We love the character of the old homes, wide streets, and old trees!  The empty lots and homes while a little bit sad are also full of possibility!\n\nWe are a block off of a busline that runs between ualr and downtown.  Pretty easy to get to and from the airport.\n\nHot Air Balloon Rides are not free, but a great deal so don't hesitate to let us plan you one!",
