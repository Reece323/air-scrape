The a/v media center was fun for catching up on shows and the back porch was a plus for gearing up for the rides. Adam is an excellent host that made our trip easy and enjoyable with his timely communication and well appointed accommodations. Thanks for the Red Bull and popcorn! \n\nWe spent three days riding Slaughter Pen and Coler trails. It's a short warm up ride into town, then to the trails in either direction. Check out Wrights BBQ and the Airship coffee shop only accessible by bike or walking in the woods. It's a nice base to meet up at if you're riding the Coler trails.",

If you are in town to mountain bike the ride is next to nothing as slaughter pen is pretty much across from the subdivision. It’s also close to the downtown and square area making that a quick commute.",

        "description": "A sparkling clean & cozy basement guest suite with private bedroom, living area, kitchenette, private bathroom, outdoor patio and seasonal pool access. A quiet neighborhood backing up to woods and hills but only minutes from all NWA has to offer. Crystal Bridges Museum, Wal-Mart Amp, walking/biking trails, quaint downtown areas, great restaurants, and more. Direct neighborhood access to trails and the Razorback Greenway.\n\nWe are sure you'll love Bentonville and our neighborhood as much as we do!\n\nADDRESSING COVID-19: We take great care in the cleaning of our guest space, and we have further increased our process to follow Airbnb’s enhanced cleaning protocol, which was developed with expert guidance. Here are a few highlights:\n\n• We sanitize high-touch surfaces, down to the doorknob\n• We use cleaners and disinfectants approved by global health agencies, and we wear protective gear to help prevent cross-contamination\n• We clean each room using extensive cleaning checklists\n• We provide extra cleaning supplies, so you can clean as you stay\n• We comply with local Arkansas and Bentonville laws, including any additional safety or cleaning guidelines\n\nWith over 350 “Sparkling Clean” ratings you can see that your health and safety is our #1 priority and that we take it seriously!\n\nThis rustic industrial guest suite has a separate private entrance and has a dedicated parking spot. Super clean and with many extra touches, this 600 square foot suite is comfortable & inviting from the moment you walk in. \n\nThe guest suite eat in kitchenette includes a microwave, Keurig and drip coffee makers, sink, mini refrigerator/freezer, toaster, electric skillet, electric kettle, crock pot, and blender. Bottled water as well as a selection of coffee, tea, and snacks are provided. Additional cleaning supplies are kept under the sink for your use during your stay should you need them. \n\nA comfortable living area with a gas fireplace where you can relax and unwind is equipped with a large projection screen TV (over 100 inches!) and stereo with sub-woofer for movie night. We include complementary Hulu, Disney+, Paramount Plus, & Prime Video for your use, as well as over 900 films in our personal digital movie collection.\n\nIf you need to get some work done, the dedicated desk space is ready for you, along with 150 Megabit internet for your use. The couch pulls out to a queen size bed allowing for space for up to 4 adults. \n\nPrivate bathroom with all the linens you'll need. And of course, a comfortable private bedroom with a 43” 4K smart TV to rest and relax after a day of adventuring! \n\nA large back deck and patio with bistro style lighting to enjoy your morning coffee on or use the fire pit on a cool night.  When in season (early May to Late September) the pool is available for your use.\n\nThe space is kid friendly, and we have a pack and play crib available upon request. \n\nNo pets, smoking, or events at any time on property please. Only registered guests are allowed on site for liability reasons.\n\nPLEASE NOTE:  The guest suite is the lowest level of our house and does connect by interior staircase to the rest of the home. We respect our guest's privacy, but note that we may hear each other or pass in the yard or entrance to your area. The backyard area and pool are shared spaces with our family. \n\nThe pool has been closed for the season and will be reopen in late April 2022. \n\nBeing on the lower floor of our home, this space is not ideal for someone who is a very light sleeper or sensitive to everyday household sounds (walking, kids playing, etc).\n\nAccess your guest suite is through your private rear entrance in the house (accessed through the backyard garden by the pool). You enter through the side gate and walk around the house to the rear door where you'll find the door with keypad ready for you.

Please keep in mind that this is a residential neighborhood while listening to music or utilizing the outdoor areas and that the backyard is a shared space with our family.\n\nWe live on property and work from home, so we are easily available during your stay for anything you need by the AirBNB app, as well as phone or text. We enjoy getting to know our guests, but our guest space has a separate entrance so you won't need to interact with us unless you need or desire to. Especially during good weather we may meet in the back yard or pool area and we’ll be so pleased to welcome you!\n\nBentonville is an amazing area best known for its southern culture, cuisine, art, and outdoor activities. Our neighborhood has direct access to the Slaughter Pen Mountain Biking park and the Razorback Greenway (Less than a 10 minute bike ride away). Coler Mountain, the Back 40, and Little Sugar network are all within a short ride or drive from the neighborhood.\n\nYou are within a 10 minute drive of Walmart and Sam's Club corporate offices, Downtown Bentonville, the Amazeum Children's Museum, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, The Momentary Museum, Museum of Native American History, and more!  There's honestly too much to list, as this area truly has it all!\n\nOur neighborhood is very family friendly, with children often riding and playing in yards. So be mindful when coming and going for children, especially when backing out of the driveway.\n\nBentonville is easy to get around thankfully! Most amenities are a short drive or even a short bike ride away. Uber & Lyft are also readily available.\n\nMORE ABOUT THIS HOME :\nWe aim for a very comfortable and inviting stay for our guests. We love this location because we are close to and have easy access to everything in the area.\n\nThis suite is ideal for guests who want more space and room to stretch out, outside living spaces, and a relaxing atmosphere and neighborhood while still being close to the action. A great fit for couples, small families, and small groups. Very convenient for business travelers wanting a place to do some work in comfort as well as very close access to the Wal-Mart and Sam's Club Home Offices, Mercy Northwest Hospital, and Northwest Medical Center.\n \nBentonville has a number of fabulous restaurants. Based on your taste preferences we would be more than happy to make recommendations, or if you feel like staying in, you're more than welcome to enjoy take out options or a meal in your suite.\n\nNWA and Bentonville specifically are rated among the very best in North America for mountain biking trails. Our neighborhood connects directly to the trail network and we are less than 1 mile from the Razorback Greenway,  while Coler Mountain,  Slaughter Pen, the Back 40, and Little Sugar trail systems are a short ride or drive away. \n\nThe suite is on the same temperature control as the main part of the house, I am happy to make adjustments to make you more comfortable. There is a common staircase that connects the guest suite to the main home so you can interact with us as much as you prefer or we can keep our distance and let you enjoy your peace and quiet, it's really up to you!\n\nThe bathroom only has a shower, no bathtub is available in the space. \n\nWe love having guests in our home and look forward to welcoming you to Bentonville!\n\nFP",
