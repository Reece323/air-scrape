The a/v media center was fun for catching up on shows and the back porch was a plus for gearing up for the rides. Adam is an excellent host that made our trip easy and enjoyable with his timely communication and well appointed accommodations. Thanks for the Red Bull and popcorn! \\n\\nWe spent three days riding Slaughter Pen and Coler trails. It's a short warm up ride into town, then to the trails in either direction. Check out Wrights BBQ and the Airship coffee shop only accessible by bike or walking in the woods. It's a nice base to meet up at if you're riding the Coler trails.\",\n",
